**Effective date:** 2025-12-13  
**Provider:** Edmund Bloomer ("we," "our," "us")

This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices when using Dice Masters Prep Area (the "App").

## Data Collection
- The App does not require account creation and does not collect personal information by default.
- If you contact us for support, we receive the information you provide (for example, your email address and message content) only to respond to your inquiry.

## Device Permissions
- The App requests only the permissions needed for its features. If you deny a permission, the related feature may not work; other features will function where possible.

## Usage and Analytics
- We do not collect analytics or usage tracking data by default. If we add analytics in the future, we will update this policy to describe what is collected and why.

## Third Parties and Sharing
- The App does not share your data with third parties except as needed to handle support communications (e.g., the email service you use to contact us).

## Children's Privacy
- The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your region), and we do not knowingly collect data from children.

## Data Retention
- Support communications are kept only as long as needed to resolve your request and maintain service quality, then deleted or anonymized.

## Security
- We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information transmitted to us, but no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.

## Your Rights
- Depending on your region, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete information you provide to us. Contact us to exercise these rights.

## Changes to This Policy
